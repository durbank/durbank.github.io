### EXPERIENCE

\
`July 2022–August 2023`
**Lead Climate Scientist: AccuWeather for Business**

*Helped businesses from a wide range of sectors (e.g. transportation, retail, energy, financial services, etc.) to understand their unique risks from climate change.*

- Spearheaded research and development of advanced methodologies to quantify climate change risk to support decision-making processes for various stakeholders
- Performed custom climate risk assessments for clients, summarizing findings in final presentations and reports
- Integrated data from diverse sources (remote sensing, climate models, weather observations, etc.) to assess impacts due to extreme heat, wind, drought, and similar climate changes
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams to integrate climate science into AccuWeather's suite of products and services, ensuring the delivery of accurate and actionable information to clients and users
- Acted internally as a subject matter expert, advising teams on proper data management and analysis for climate and geospatial data
- Communicated with clients and the general public as a climate science expert, representing AccuWeather at conferences, industry events, and media engagements

`Sept 2016–July 2022`
**Research Scientist: University of Utah**

*Utilized remote sensing, spatiotemporal statistics, and computational modeling to explore polar and alpine glacier responses to climate change.*

- Developed an automated probabilistic computer vision method to reconstruct spatially-distributed polar precipitation time series from radar imagery, increasing available data by a factor of 300
<!-- - Developed and deployed QA/QC subroutines to automatically identify potential data issues -->
- Effectively utilized code parallelization and high-performance computing to scalably deploy method to large datasets (100's of gigabytes)
- Applied machine learning and Bayesian inference to predict glacier melt in response to climate change, leading to improved understanding of its impact on sea level
- Directed three interdisciplinary science teams with diverse expertise across 4 organizations, resulting in 7 publications and the 2021 Excellence in Research Award from the University of Utah

`Jan 2016–July 2022`
**Laboratory Manager: University of Utah**

*Managed research lab investigating snow, water, and ice in regions across the globe.
Primary analytical tools included laser spectroscopy, computational modeling, isotope geochemistry, and geophysical instruments.*

- Successfully negotiated with outside vendors to decrease procurement costs by 20+% during lab start up
- Developed and maintained laser spectroscopy capabilities for stable isotope analyses
- Increased productivity by creating standard reporting/operating procedures
- Mentored 14 students in completing and successfully defending research theses

`Sept 2013–Dec 2015`
**Research Scientist: Brigham Young University**

*Collaborative project between BYU and Columbia University to reconstruct abrupt climate changes in Europe from glacier responses using process modeling and isotope geochemistry.*

- Developed a stochastic glacier model to estimate climate changes from minimal surface measurements, providing climate constraints from previously unavailable records with robust uncertainty assessments
- Utilized machine learning to distinguish snow and ice in multispectral satellite imagery, permitting model calibration, validation, and uncertainty quantification
- Effectively communicated findings to both expert and non-technical audiences, winning Best in Session presentation awards in three separate BYU Spring Research conferences
- Improved student success by modernizing course curricula in GIS and field study courses, leading to receipt of the 2015 Outstanding Teaching Award

<!-- `May 2012–Aug 2012`
**Geology intern: Forest Oil Corporation**

*Quantified correlations between well success and various 3D seismic attributes in the Permian Basin to help identify future well sites and constrain risk assessments.*

- Increased team's potential for well success rates through data-driven analysis
- Identified and solved issues with minimal oversight
- Quickly developed new skills as needed (e.g. IHS Kingdom seismic software suite)
- Summarized technical results to managers in concise and informative reports -->

<!-- `Sept 2009–May 2011`
**Admissions and Financial Aid Associate: BYU Student Services**

*Assisted clients in navigating admissions and financial aid requirements at Brigham Young University.*

- Quickly developed and employed expertise in a broad range of topics
- Defused volatile situations with confident competency and empathic communication
- Ensured customer satisfaction using a detail-oriented approach, facilitating inter-department teamwork, and actionable follow-ups -->
