## EXPERIENCE

`Jan 2016–Sept 2021`
**Snow Water and Ice Research Lab Manager: University of Utah**

Supervised lab purchasing, equipment maintenance, development of standard operating procedures, and training of lab members.

- Decreased procurement costs by 20+% during lab start up
- Improved lab coordination by initiating regular reports on status of equipment
- Increased productivity/accuracy by creating standard operating procedures
- Mentored 14 students in completing and successfully defending research theses
- Methodically divided large projects into manageable short-term goals to be accomplished by others

`Sept 2016–Aug 2021`
**Doctoral researcher: University of Utah**

Reconstructed polar precipitation time series from radar and assessed their climatic significance using machine learning and Bayesian inference.
Results demonstrated decreased precipitation in central West Antarctica, indicating changes in hemispheric moisture transport.

- Initiated, designed, and implemented 3 separate projects with overlapping time frames and collaborated on numerous other projects
- Developed automated computer vision algorithms for radar imagery that increased available data >300x compared to in-situ observations
- Collaborated with statisticians to implement a hierarchical Bayesian polar snow density model, permitting improved uncertainty quantification
- Communicated findings to both expert and non-technical audiences through publications, data visualizations, presentations, and  grant proposals

`Jan 2017–Dec 2019`
**Course Instructor: University of Utah**

Taught graduate and undergraduate courses, including lecturing and course development.

- Communicated complex topics to non-experts in engaging and understandable formats
- Demonstrated initiative and creativity in crafting captivating lectures and informative labs
- Engaged students with open dialogue and an overt passion for the subject matter

`Sept 2013–Dec 2015`
**Graduate Student Researcher: Brigham Young University**

Reconstructed abrupt climate change from glacier responses through modeling and isotopic geochemistry.
Results demonstrated changes in summertime temperature were the primary mechanism for European Alps glacier changes.

- Independently identified issues, researched possible answers, and implemented optimal solutions
- Developed stochastic model to estimate climate changes from minimal paleoglacier measurements
- Collaborated with geochemists at Columbia University to constrain ages of glacier responses

`Sept 2013–Aug 2015`
**Graduate Teaching Assistant: Brigham Young University**

Helped teach courses in a variety of topics (advanced statistics, resource geology, geochemistry, scientific communication).

- Effectively communicated complex, technical issues to non-expert audiences in intuitive formats
- Improved student success by modernizing course curricula to use preferred skills (e.g. ArcGIS tutorials, remote sensing analysis)
- Methodically implemented the vision of supervisors without the need for direct oversight

<!-- `Sept 2011–June 2013`
**Undergraduate Researcher: Brigham Young University**

A brief description of the role...

- Reconstruction of Antarctic moisture sources using deuterium excess analyses
- Important implications for understanding atmospheric circulation and moisture transport in the Southern Hemisphere
- Included geochemical analysis, statistical analysis, and atmospheric interpretation
- Results showed a greater contribution from high latitude sources for West Antarctica -->

`May 2012–Aug 2012`
**Geology intern: Forest Oil Corporation**

Quantified correlations between well success and various 3D seismic attributes to help identify future well sites and constrain current risk assessments.
Final results indicated that seismic anisotropy is a key indicator for well success within the Permian Basin.

- Increased team's potential for well success rates through data-driven analysis
- Identified and solved issues with minimal oversight
- Quickly developed new skills as needed (e.g. IHS Kingdom seismic software suite)
- Summarized technical results to managers in concise and informative reports

`Sept 2009–May 2011`
**Admissions and Financial Aid Associate: BYU Student Services**

Assisted clients in navigating admissions and financial aid requirements.

- Quickly developed and employed expertise in a broad range of topics
- Defused volatile situations with confident competency and empathic communication
- Ensured customer satisfaction using a detail-oriented approach, facilitating inter-department teamwork, and actionable follow-ups
