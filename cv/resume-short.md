## SUMMARY

Earth and climate scientist with 10 years experience specializing in geospatial analysis, remote sensing, and computational modeling

## SKILLS

**Programming languages:** Python, R, MATLAB, bash scripting \
**Computing:** Version control, Linux environments, PyMC3 \
**Statistics:** Geospatial analysis, time series analysis, machine learning, probabilistic programming, Bayesian inference \
**Data types:** GIS, geospatial data, climate models, VNIR/optical imagery, radar, remote sensing

## EXPERIENCE

`Jan 2016–Present`
**Laboratory Manager: University of Utah**

Research laboratory investigating snow, water, and ice in regions across the globe.
Primary analytical tools include isotope geochemistry, refractory black carbon, aqueous geochemistry, ice core analysis, and geophysical instruments.

- Decreased procurement costs by 20+% during lab start up
- Increased lab productivity/accuracy by creating standard operating procedures reporting standards
- Mentored 14 students in completing and successfully defending research theses

`Sept 2016–Aug 2021`
**Research Scientist: University of Utah**

Leveraged remote sensing, spatiotemporal statistics, geochemistry, and computational modeling to explore polar and alpine responses to climate change.
<!-- Specific investigations included reconstruction and analysis of polar precipitation time series and analyses of glacier mass loss across High Mountain Asia. -->
Additionally taught both undergraduate and graduate courses in a variety of topics.

- Led three interdisciplinary teams with diverse expertise across 4 organizations, resulting in 7 publications and the 2021 Excellence in Research Award from the University of Utah
- Developed automated probabilistic computer vision algorithms for radar imagery that increased available data by a factor of 300
- Implemented a hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework for snow density modeling, providing robust uncertainty quantification
- Bullet point about HMA work...

`Sept 2013–Dec 2015`
**Research Scientist: Brigham Young University**

Reconstructed abrupt climate changes in Europe from glacier responses using modeling and isotope geochemistry.
Collaborative project between BYU and Columbia University.
Also included extensive student mentoring and teaching of undergraduate students.

- Developed stochastic model to estimate climate changes from surface geomorphology, resulting in method to extract records from minimal information with robust uncertainty assessment
- Utilized machine learning to develop classifier to distinguish snow and ice in optical satellite imagery
- Effectively communicated findings to both expert and non-technical audiences, winning Best in Session presentation awards in three separate BYU Spring Research conferences
- Improved student success by modernizing course curricula to use preferred skills, leading to receipt of the 2015 Outstanding Teaching Award

`May 2012–Aug 2012`
**Geology intern: Forest Oil Corporation**

Quantified correlations between well success and various 3D seismic attributes to help identify future well sites and constrain current risk assessments.
Final results indicated that seismic anisotropy is a key indicator for well success within the Permian Basin.

- Increased team's potential for well success rates through data-driven analysis
- Identified and solved issues with minimal oversight
- Quickly developed new skills as needed (e.g. IHS Kingdom seismic software suite)
- Summarized technical results to managers in concise and informative reports

`Sept 2009–May 2011`
**Admissions and Financial Aid Associate: BYU Student Services**

Assisted clients in navigating admissions and financial aid requirements at Brigham Young University.

- Quickly developed and employed expertise in a broad range of topics
- Defused volatile situations with confident competency and empathic communication
- Ensured customer satisfaction using a detail-oriented approach, facilitating inter-department teamwork, and actionable follow-ups

## EDUCATION

`Dec 2015`
**M.S. Geology**\
Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah

`Aug 2013`
**B.S. Geology (physics minor)**\
Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah
