### EXPERIENCE

\
`Sept 2016–Present`
**Research Scientist: University of Utah**

Leveraging remote sensing, spatiotemporal statistics, geochemistry, and computational modeling to explore polar and alpine glacier responses to climate change.
Additionally taught both undergraduate and graduate courses in a variety of topics.

- Led three interdisciplinary science teams with diverse expertise across 4 organizations, resulting in 7 publications and the 2021 Excellence in Research Award from the University of Utah
- Developed an automated probabilistic computer vision method to reconstruct polar precipitation time series from radar imagery, increasing available data by a factor of 300
- Implemented a hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework for snow density modeling, providing robust uncertainty quantification of unknown environmental factors
- Applied multiple forms of AI/machine learning to predict the spatial distribution of glacier melt in response to climate change, leading to improved predictions and modeling of alpine hydrology and sea level rise

`Jan 2016–Present`
**Laboratory Manager: University of Utah**

Research laboratory investigating snow, water, and ice in regions across the globe.
Primary analytical tools include computational modeling, isotope geochemistry, aqueous geochemistry, ice core analysis, and geophysical instruments.

- Decreased procurement costs by 20+% during lab start up, freeing additional funding for other projects
- Increased lab productivity by creating standard operating procedures and reporting standards for lab equipment
- Mentored 14 students in completing and successfully defending research theses

`Sept 2013–Dec 2015`
**Research Scientist: Brigham Young University**

Collaborative project between BYU and Columbia University reconstructing abrupt climate changes in Europe from glacier responses using process modeling and isotope geochemistry.
Also included extensive student mentoring and teaching of undergraduate students.

- Developed a stochastic glacier model to estimate climate changes from minimal surface measurements, providing climate constraints for new regions with robust uncertainty assessments
- Utilized machine learning to develop a classifier to distinguish snow and ice in optical satellite imagery, permitting stochastic model calibration, validation, and uncertainty quantification
- Effectively communicated findings to both expert and non-technical audiences, winning Best in Session presentation awards in three separate BYU Spring Research conferences
- Improved student success by modernizing course curricula in GIS and field study courses, leading to receipt of the 2015 Outstanding Teaching Award

`May 2012–Aug 2012`
**Geology intern: Forest Oil Corporation**

Quantified correlations between well success and various 3D seismic attributes in the Permian Baisn to help identify future well sites and constrain risk assessments.

- Increased team's potential for well success rates through data-driven analysis
- Identified and solved issues with minimal oversight
- Quickly developed new skills as needed (e.g. IHS Kingdom seismic software suite)
- Summarized technical results to managers in concise and informative reports

`Sept 2009–May 2011`
**Admissions and Financial Aid Associate: BYU Student Services**

Assisted clients in navigating admissions and financial aid requirements at Brigham Young University.

- Quickly developed and employed expertise in a broad range of topics
- Defused volatile situations with confident competency and empathic communication
- Ensured customer satisfaction using a detail-oriented approach, facilitating inter-department teamwork, and actionable follow-ups
