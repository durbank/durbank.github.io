## Experience

### Research

`2016–2021`
**Doctoral researcher: University of Utah**

- Self-directed and collaborative projects focused on the global cryosphere
- Developed/implemented computer vision algorithms to reconstruct polar precipitation time series from radar
- Fully automated, scalable workflow, increasing available data ~300x compared to in-situ observations
- Collaborative research to implement a hierarchical Bayesian polar snow density model, permitting more robust uncertainty quantification
- Excellent written and oral communication skills, evident in numerous publications and conference presentations

<!-- - Assessment of High Mountain Asia glacio-climate zones through leveraging of regional climate modeling and machine learning
- Increased predictive power of glacier storage inference models, with important implications for water resource management -->

`2013–2015`
**Graduate Student Researcher: Brigham Young University**

- Autonomous research of glacier responses to past abrupt climate changes
- Developed stochastic glacier model to estimate climate changes from minimal measurements, providing more robust uncertainty quantification
- Collaborative project with Lamont Doeherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University to constrain ages of glacier responses

<!-- - Hydrological modeling of glacier melt and run-off to inform future river flow used in French nuclear reactor cooling -->

`2011–2013`
**Undergraduate Researcher: Brigham Young University**

- Reconstruction of West Antarctic moisture source regions using deuterium excess analyses from shallow ice cores
- Results showed a greater contribution from high latitude sources for West Antarctica

### Leadership

`2016–2021`
**Snow Water and Ice Research Lab Manager: University of Utah**

- Responsible for the procurement, maintenance, training, and use of lab equipment
- Decreased lab procurement costs by 20+% during lab start up
- Streamlined and standardized lab operating procedures, resulting in greatly increased productivity, throughput, and accuracy
- Primary research advisor for one Master's student, resulting in successful completion and defense of research (December 2020)
- Demonstrated the ability to methodically divide large projects into manageable short-term goals to be accomplished by others

`2017–2019`
**Course Instructor: University of Utah**

- Instructor of record for graduate-level course (Cryospheric Data Analysis: Fall 2019)
- Developed and taught module on Gaussian processes for graduate level statistics course
- Exceptional organizational skills and attention to detail demonstrated through methodical instruction in advanced topics

`2013–2015`
**Graduate Teaching Assistant: Brigham Young University**

- Helped teach courses in a variety of topics (advanced statistics, resource geology, geochemistry, scientific communication)
- Helped redesign and update courses, including courses for field camp and introductory ArcGIS
- Proven ability to effectively communicate complex, technical issues to non-expert audiences
