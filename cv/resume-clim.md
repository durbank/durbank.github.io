**Statistics:** Spatiotemporal modeling, climate model downscaling, probabilistic analysis \
**Data types**: CMIP6 climate models, multidimensional NetCDFs, raster/vector spatial datasets

### EXPERIENCE

\
`July 2022–August 2023`
**Lead Climate Scientist: AccuWeather for Business**

*Helped businesses from a wide range of sectors (transportation, retail, energy, financial services, etc.) understand their unique risks from climate change.*

- Spearheaded research and development of advanced methodologies and tools to quantify physical climate hazards, including climate model downscaling and uncertainty analyses
- Generated custom climate risk/vulnerability assessment reports and recommendations for clients, including probabilistic considerations of uncertainty
- Integrated data from diverse sources (CMIP6 model ensembles, model downscaling, meteorological observations, etc.) to assess impacts due to extreme heat, wind, drought, and similar climate changes
<!-- - Collaborated with cross-functional teams to obtain, analyze, and interpret climate data and integrate climate science into AccuWeather's suite of products and services -->
- Acted internally as a subject matter expert, advising teams on proper data management and analysis for climate data
- Communicated with clients and the general public as a climate science expert, representing AccuWeather at conferences, industry events, and media engagements

`Sept 2016–July 2022`
**Climate Research Scientist: University of Utah**

*Utilized radar remote sensing, spatiotemporal statistics, and computational modeling to explore polar and alpine glacier responses to climate change.*

- Directed three interdisciplinary science teams with diverse expertise across 4 organizations, resulting in 7 publications and the 2021 Excellence in Research Award from the University of Utah
- Developed an automated probabilistic computer vision method to reconstruct polar precipitation time series from radar imagery, increasing available data by a factor of 300
- Effectively utilized code parallelization and high-performance computing to scalably deploy method to large geophysical datasets
<!-- - Implemented a hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework for snow density modeling, providing robust uncertainty quantification of unknown environmental factors -->
- Applied machine learning and Bayesian inference to predict glacier melt in response to climate change, leading to improved understanding of high mountain water resources

`Jan 2016–July 2022`
**Laboratory Manager: University of Utah**

*Managed research lab investigating snow, water, and ice in regions across the globe.
Primary analytical tools included laser spectroscopy, computational modeling, isotope geochemistry, and geophysical instruments.*

- Successfully negotiated with outside vendors to decrease procurement costs by 20+% during lab start up
- Developed and maintained laser spectroscopy capabilities for stable isotope analyses
- Increased productivity by creating standard reporting/operating procedures for lab equipment
- Mentored 14 students in completing and successfully defending research theses

`Sept 2013–Dec 2015`
**Research Scientist: Brigham Young University**

*Collaborative project between BYU and Columbia University to reconstruct abrupt climate changes using glacier modeling and isotope geochemistry.*

- Developed a stochastic glacier model to estimate climate changes from minimal surface measurements, providing climate constraints from previously unavailable records with robust uncertainty assessments
- Utilized machine learning to distinguish snow and ice in multispectral satellite imagery, permitting model calibration, validation, and uncertainty quantification
- Developed a hydrological run-off model for glacial melt to better predict glacial contributions to downstream water resources
- Effectively communicated findings to both expert and non-technical audiences, winning Best in Session presentation awards in three separate BYU Spring Research conferences
- Improved student success by modernizing course curricula in GIS and field study courses, leading to receipt of the 2015 Outstanding Teaching Award

<!-- `May 2012–Aug 2012`
**Geology intern: Forest Oil Corporation**

*Quantified correlations between well success and various 3D seismic attributes in the Permian Basin to help identify future well sites and constrain risk assessments.*

- Increased team's potential for well success rates through data-driven analysis
- Identified and solved issues with minimal oversight
- Quickly developed new skills as needed (e.g. IHS Kingdom seismic software suite)
- Summarized technical results to managers in concise and informative reports -->
