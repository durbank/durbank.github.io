## RESEARCH

`2020-Present`
**Glacio-climate characteristics of High Mountain Asia**

- Investigations of High Mountain Asia glacier mass balance by leveraging regional climate modeling, machine learning, and Bayesian spatial analysis
- Quantifies the relative influence of climatic forcing and glacial/geomorphic attributes on glacier mass balance
- Research indicates large variability in responses can result from transient climate sensitivity in addition to climatic forcing and equilibrium climate sensitivity
- Important implications for water resource management within High Mountain Asia and downstream communities

`2016-Present`
**Reconstruction of surface mass balance time series from radar**

- Developed and implemented computer vision algorithms to reconstruct West Antarctic precipitation time series using airborne radar data
- Worked with other experts to implement snow density modeling within a Bayesian framework, permitting more robust uncertainty quantification
- Led to a fully automated, scalable workflow that increased available data over 300x compared to in-situ observations
- Results demonstrated important changes to West Antarctic moisture transport with implications on future sea level

`2016`
**Glacier melt and hydrology modeling**

- Modeled glacier melt and melt contribution to the Rhone Watershed
- Developed and implemented a surface energy and mass balance + hydrological glacier melt model to simulate melt runoff throughout the year
- Demonstrated ability to identify and solve issues with little oversight and effectively communicate results to others

`2013-2015`
**Paleoclimate reconstructions from glacial record**

- Developed glacier model to estimate climate changes from minimal measurements
- Collaboration with researchers at Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory for cosmogenic radionuclide dating of samples
- Permitted direct quantitative climatic assessments across diverse regions and settings
- Provided robust uncertainty quantification, allowing for more detailed sensitivity assessment
- Results indicated cooling of summertime temperatures were responsible for Swiss glacier advances during the Younger Dryas (~12,000 years BCE)

`2011-2012`
**Provenance of West Antarctic moisture using deuterium excess**

- Reconstruction of West Antarctic moisture source regions using deuterium excess analyses from shallow ice cores
