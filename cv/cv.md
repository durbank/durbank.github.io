`2015-Present`
**Lab manager for the University of Utah Snow, Water and Ice Research Lab:**
In addition to general lab and equipment upkeep, responsibilities included the development, maintenance and operation of the
SWIRL stable water isotope protocols/analysis and general lab training for incoming lab members.

Investigations of paleoclimatology and glacial history of the Swiss Alps during the Younger Dryas.
Included the development and implementation of a physically based ELA model, lab preparation and analysis of Be-10 for cosmogenic radionuclide dating, field mapping/sampling of glacial moraines and glacial melt water, and building surface energy and mass balance and hydrology routing models for glacier melt.
