## EDUCATION

`Aug 2021`
**Ph.D. Geography**\
University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah

`Dec 2015`

### EXPERIENCE

\
`Sept 2016–Present`
**Research Scientist: University of Utah**

*Utilized remote sensing, spatiotemporal statistics, geochemistry, and computational modeling to explore polar and alpine glacier responses to climate change.
Additionally taught both undergraduate and graduate courses in a variety of topics.*

- Directed three interdisciplinary science teams with diverse expertise across 4 organizations, resulting in 7 publications and the 2021 Excellence in Research Award from the University of Utah
- Developed an automated probabilistic computer vision method to reconstruct polar precipitation time series from radar imagery, increasing available data by a factor of 300
- Effectively utilized code parallelization and high-performance computing to scalably deploy method to large datasets (100's of terabytes)
- Applied machine learning and Bayesian inference to predict glacier melt in response to climate change, leading to improved understanding of alpine hydrology and sea level rise

`Jan 2016–Present`
**Laboratory Manager: University of Utah**

*Managed research lab investigating snow, water, and ice in regions across the globe.
Primary analytical tools included laser spectroscopy, computational modeling, isotope geochemistry, and geophysical instruments.*

- Successfully negotiated with outside vendors to decrease procurement costs by 20+% during lab start up
- Developed and maintained lab laser spectroscopy capabilities for stable water isotope analyses
- Increased productivity by creating standard operating procedures and reporting standards for lab equipment
- Mentored 14 students in completing and successfully defending research theses

`Sept 2013–Dec 2015`
**Research Scientist: Brigham Young University**

*Collaborative project between BYU and Columbia University to reconstruct abrupt climate changes in Europe from glacier responses using process modeling and isotope geochemistry.
Also included extensive student mentoring and teaching of undergraduate students.*

- Developed a stochastic glacier model to estimate climate changes from minimal surface measurements, providing climate constraints from previously unavailable records with robust uncertainty assessments
- Utilized machine learning to distinguish snow and ice in multispectral satellite imagery, permitting model calibration, validation, and uncertainty quantification
- Effectively communicated findings to both expert and non-technical audiences, winning Best in Session presentation awards in three separate BYU Spring Research conferences
- Improved student success by modernizing course curricula in GIS and field study courses, leading to receipt of the 2015 Outstanding Teaching Award

`May 2012–Aug 2012`
**Geology intern: Forest Oil Corporation**

*Quantified correlations between well success and various 3D seismic attributes in the Permian Basin to help identify future well sites and constrain risk assessments.*

- Increased team's potential for well success rates through data-driven analysis
- Identified and solved issues with minimal oversight
- Quickly developed new skills as needed (e.g. IHS Kingdom seismic software suite)
- Summarized technical results to managers in concise and informative reports

`Sept 2009–May 2011`
**Admissions and Financial Aid Associate: BYU Student Services**

*Assisted clients in navigating admissions and financial aid requirements at Brigham Young University.*

- Quickly developed and employed expertise in a broad range of topics
- Defused volatile situations with confident competency and empathic communication
- Ensured customer satisfaction using a detail-oriented approach, facilitating inter-department teamwork, and actionable follow-ups
