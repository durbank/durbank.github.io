## Experience

### Research

`2016–2021`
**Trends in Antarctic precipitation**

- Developed and implemented computer vision algorithms to reconstruct West Antarctic precipitation time series using airborne radar data
- Worked with other experts to implement snow density modeling within a Bayesian framework, permitting more robust uncertainty quantification
- Led to a fully automated, scalable workflow that increased available data over 300x compared to in-situ observations
- Results demonstrated important changes to West Antarctic moisture transport with implications on future sea level
<!-- - Collaboratively worked with experts from other fields, resulting in 5 article submissions -->

`2020–2021`
**Glacio-climate zones of High Mountain Asia**

- Investigated High Mountain Asia glacier groups by leveraging regional climate modeling and machine learning
- Led to doubling of predictive power of mass balance inference models
- Important implications for water resource management within High Mountain Asia

`2016`
**Glacier melt and hydrology modeling**

- Surface energy and balance mass + hydrological modeling of glacier run-off
- Modeled glacier melt and melt contribution to the Rhone Watershed
- Demonstrated ability to identify and solve issues with little oversight and effectively communicate results to others

`2013–2015`
**Climate reconstruction from paleoglaciers**

- Developed glacier model to estimate climate changes from minimal measurements
- Permitted direct quantitative climatic assessments across diverse regions and settings compared to more traditional qualitative approaches
- Provided robust uncertainty quantification, allowing for more detailed risk and sensitivity assessment

`2011–2012`
**Antarctic moisture source provenance**

- Reconstruction of West Antarctic moisture source regions using deuterium excess analyses from shallow ice cores
- Results showed a greater contribution from high latitude sources for West Antarctica

<!-- `2012`
**Geology intern—Forest Oil Corporation**

- Quantified correlations between well success and 3D seismic attributes to help identify future well sites and constrain risk assessments
- Results indicated seismic anisotropy as a key predictor of well success, allowing for more targeted site exploration and selection
- Demonstrated ability to identify and solve issues with little oversight and effectively communicate results to others -->

### Leadership

`2016–2021`
**Snow Water and Ice Research Lab Manager**

- Responsible for the procurement, maintenance, and use of lab equipment, including training other lab members
- Decreased lab procurement costs by 20+% during lab start up
- Streamlined and standardized lab operating procedures, resulting in greatly increased productivity, throughput, and accuracy

`2020`
**Research Mentor**

- Primary research mentor for an Master's of Science for Secondary School Teachers graduate student
- Guided student to successful completion and defense of research investigating Greenland snow accumulation in recent decades
- Demonstrated the ability to methodically divide large projects into manageable short-term goals to be accomplished by others

`2019`
**Course Instructor**

- Instructor of record for the graduate-level course, Cryospheric Data Analysis
- Developed and taught a module on Gaussian processes for a graduate level statistics course
- Proven ability to convey complex topics in approachable and intuitive formats to diverse audiences

`2013–2015`
**Teaching Assistant**

- Helped teach courses in a variety of topics (advanced statistics, resource geology, geochemistry, scientific communication)
<!-- - Went beyond minimum requirements (organized study sessions for students, met with them individually, etc.) to help others master the subject matter and succeed in their projects -->
- Demonstrated strong interpersonal communication skills
