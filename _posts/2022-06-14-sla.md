This was a project embedded into my master's research.
The broader project focused on reconstructing the magnitude of abrupt climate change during a period ~12,000 years ago using changes in glacier size and shape.
I used the present day climate as reference for my comparisons using a glacier concept called the equilibrium line altitude (ELA).
Briefly, this is the elevation on a glacier where the annual mass losses exactly equal the mass gains, i.e. the glacier is in equilibrium at this elevation when averaged over the whole year.
This is a useful metric as it integrates the myriad climatic controls (changes in temperature/melt, changes in precipitation/accumulation, etc.) into a single metric that can be easily compared to other nearby glaciers or the same glacier at different periods of time.
For more information on the other aspects of the research, take a look at [my thesis](https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/6142).

In order to compare my estimates for glacier ELAs in the past to the present, however, I needed ELA estimates for present-day glaciers in the same locations.
A handful of glaciers in the world have direct measurements of ELAs, but many glaciers do not.
Worse still, some glaciers that existed during the end of the last ice age no longer exist today, so no direct measurements are even possible.
I therefore needed a method to estimate present-day ELAs when no measurements (or even the glacier itself) exist.
I furthermore desired an automated method that could be applied in arbitrary locations.
I accomplished this by estimating the elevation of the snow/ice transition at the end of summer from LANDSAT8 imagery and a digital elevation model (DEM).
In this post, I walk through this method and showcase some representative results.

*NOTE: If you are interested in the technical details of the implementation, the code for the following analyses and figures is hosted on my [GitHub page](/assets/blog-code/sla/).*

## Data and methods

To determine the location of snow/ice at the end of summer, I use LANDSAT 8 Level 2 satellite imagery from July, August, and September.
To define end of summer, I determine which tile from these months has the lowest fraction of snow-covered area, which should represent the minimum extent of snow for the year and therefore the end of the summer melt season.
The [Landsat 8 Science Product Guide](https://d9-wret.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/palladium/production/s3fs-public/atoms/files/LSDS-1619_Landsat8-C2-L2-ScienceProductGuide-v2.pdf) helpfully provides some basic pixel classifications and image quality assessments that we use in determining fractional snow-covered area of total usable pixels (see Table 6-3 in the preceding link).
The above guide is also used to convert pixel values reflectance values for each band (see band specifications in Table 6-1).

Unfortunately, the pixel classifications provided with Landsat 8 lump all cryospheric land types into a single class, while I require a differentiation between snow and ice.
I therefore use a 2-component Gaussian mixture model with Landsat Bands 2-5 (blue, green, red, and near-infrared) as input to discern between snow and ice pixels, assigning each pixel probabilities of representing snow/ice.

With these classifications complete, I then find all snow/ice pixels that lie within 50 m of a pixel of the other class and assume these pixels lie on the snow-ice transition line.
This gives me the spatial distribution of the snowline (and iceline) across a given region of interest.
These lines should both approximate the position of the equilibrium line of a glacier in the same location, even if a glacier does not actually currently exist there.
I then use the intersection of these pixel locations with the [Copernicus 30-m DEM](https://spacedata.copernicus.eu/web/cscda/dataset-details?articleId=394198) to extract the distribution of plausible equilibrium line altitudes in the selected region.

To get a final estimate for the ELA (along with an idea of the variability in this estimate) we can look at the distribution in snow and ice elevations for the assumed snow/ice lines across the basin or region of interest.
We might be able to do better though, as we also have information regarding the likelihood of each pixel actually belonging to its assigned class (we get these probabilities from the Gaussian mixture model).
We can therefore generate mean and standard deviation estimates weighted by the class assignment probabilities to get our final ELA estimate and uncertainty involved.

Because we calculate the snow and ice lines separately, we can pull out additional detail about the accuracy of our method and its suitability to the target region.
In an ideal situation, the ice line altitude and the snow line altitude should be the same and both should equal the equilibrium line altitude.
In reality, there will likely be some difference between the snow and ice line altitudes, with the snow line biased towards high elevations and the ice line biased towards lower elevations.
These should, however, still bound the (unknown) ELA.

## Example results

To showcase this method, I will focus on a particular glacier valley in Switzerland.
The Aletsch Glacier is the largest glacier in the Swiss Alps and therefore serves as a useful target for a representative example.
Figure 1 shows this glacier valley using the true color bands of Landsat 8 alongside the elevations over the region.

*Figure 1. The Aletsch Glacier and the immediate surrounding area. The left image shows the true color composite from Landsat 8 imagery from September 05 2020&mdash;determined to be the end-of-summer (i.e. the end of the melt season) for that year based on fraction of snow-covered area. The right image shows the elevation (derived from the COP 30-m DEM) over the same region. Note the missing data in the Landsat image (shown as black or multicolored pixels-this occurs when only some bands are missing values).*

We can look at the individual Landsat bands to get some idea of how easily distinguishable snow and ice are from each other in each band.
That is shown for the 4 bands used in our Gaussian mixture model in Figure 2.

*Figure 2. The reflectance in individual bands used for the separation of snow and ice pixels. Note the gradient is values near regions of transition between snow and ice.*

The histograms of reflectance values for cyrosphere pixels for each of these bands (see Figure 3) shows bimodal distributions in each, corresponding to the difference in snow and ice reflectance in each band.
These differences are exploited in the Gaussian mixture model to assign snow and ice class probabilities.

*Figure 3. Histograms of snow/ice pixel reflectance values for each of the 4 bands used in the analysis (color scheme matches that shown in Figure 2). Note the bimodal distribution in each histogram resulting from the mixed nature (i.e. both snow and ice pixels) of the cyrosphere-labeled classes.*

With these probabilities assigned, we have distinct snow and ice classes that we can use to estimate end-of-summer snowline and iceline elevations (which in theory should bound the *in-situ* ELA).
The spatial distribution of the extracted elevations for this example glacier valley are shown in Figure 4, along with density plots of the elevation distributions for the snow (cyan) ice (blue) lines.

Remember that we can improve the estimated ELA (and corresponding distribution) by weighting estimates on the snow/ice class probabilities.
The weighted and unweighted distributions are shown in Figure 5.
As you can see, in this particular case the weighting had almost no impact on our final estimates, but this process can be helpful in other areas.

The color scheme matches that shown in the far-right inset of Figure 4. Black vertical lines denote the modal estimates of the respective snow/ice lines. Elevation weighting is performed based on assigned snow/ice class probabilities. Note that for this region, the weighting is virtually indistinguishable from the unweighted results, but this will not be the case for all regions.*

Our final estimate of the ELA in the Aletsch Glacier valley is that it lies between 3,144&plusmn;253 and 3,162&plusmn;239 meters.
