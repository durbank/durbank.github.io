title: Interactivity tests
---

I'm just testing out whether I can get interactive figures to easily show up in my research posts.
I'm using a few examples from my WAIS accumulation research.

## Motivation

Stuff about sea level rise, how accumulation is hard to measure in Antarctica, etc.

## Background

- Ice-penetrating radar
- PAIPR algorithms
- Importance of central WAIS to understanding climate
- Etc.

## Data and Materials

Focused on a region of central West Antarctica.
The below figure shows the general location of interest along with the data used in this study.

[![](/assets/img/wais-accum/maps-static.png) Plot of the region of study for this investigation (central West Antarctica) along with a map showing the location of data used in this study. The blue triangles show the location of drilled ice cores in the region, while the red pixels show the locations of radar-derived snow accumulation time series used in the study. Colored elevation contour lines are also shown (blue colormap) as well as surface topopgraphy as expressed with the background hillshade.

## Results

[![](/assets/img/wais-accum/accum-static.png) Plots showing the mean accumulation rate (mm/yr) over the full time series for each radar pixel and ice core (left) and the total duration (in years) for each radar time series (right).

And then we have some more results, that indicate importance of trend changes...

[![](/assets/img/wais-accum/trend-static.png) Linear trend in accumulation (expressed as a % change relative to the local multi-decadal mean accumulation rate) for the period 1979â€“2010 for radar-derived and core-derived time series. Note the low bias between radar-derived estimates and the independent core-based estimates. Also note the broad spatial pattern in accumulation trends, with more negative results in the western portions (bottom of the figure) and less negative/more stable trends to the east (top of the figure).
