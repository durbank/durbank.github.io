I am an Earth Scientist who specializes in leveraging remote sensing, computational modeling, and machine learning to investigate changes in the cryosphere in the recent past and near future.
I conduct research involving polar ice sheets, mountain glaciers, and seasonal snow to investigate and infer recent changes in climate.
I have particular interests in the quantification of uncertainty (typically within a Bayesian framework) and the automation of inference regarding these changes.

I attended Brigham Young University and the University of Utah for my M.S. and Ph.D. degrees.
