I am an Earth scientist specializing in remote sensing, probabilistic modeling, machine learning, and statistical inference applied to the Earth domain.
I also have a strong interest in the quantification of uncertainty within spatio-temporal predictions and modeling results.
Additionally, I strongly believe in the value and importance of open source and open science resources to accelerate the progress of scientific inquiry and society at large.

My research objectives primarily focus on understanding natural and anthropogenic climate change and characterizing their impact on physical and human systems.
My principle domain expertise focuses on glaciology and the cryosphere more generally, with additional expertise in climate dynamics, paleoclimatic reconstruction, water resources, and geologic processes.
I use a variety of tools for my research, including high performance computing, machine learning/automation, Bayesian inference, satellite imagery/sensor data, geochemical records, and climate modeling.

<!-- I attended Brigham Young University and the University of Utah for my M.S. and Ph.D. degrees. -->
